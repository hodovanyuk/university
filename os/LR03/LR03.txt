2.1 Primitives access files on a UNIX system

Exercise 2.1. Create a small program described above. Check out her work, provided that the file junk does not exist. Then create a junk file with a text editor and again zapustite program. The contents of the file junk does not matter.

- No file in the directory --
hodovanyuk:~/workspace/LR03 $ gcc 2_1.c

hodovanyuk:~/workspace/LR03 $ ./a.out

There is no file hodovanyuk:~/workspace/LR03 $ 


-- With a file in the directory --
Output: 0



2.3 Write a small program that creates the file first using the creat call, then not calling close immediately opens it using the system call open read-in one case, and write in another. In both cases use printf() to print the message about success or failure.
