€≤    Everything for learning assembly language in one pack! Emu8086        ≤€
€≤    combines an advanced source editor, assembler, disassembler,          ≤€
€≤    software emulator (Virtual PC) with debugger, and step by step        ≤€
€≤    tutorials. This program is extremely helpful for those who just       ≤€
€≤    begin to study assembly language. It compiles the source code and     ≤€
€≤    executes it on emulator step by step.                                 ≤€
€≤    Visual interface is very easy to work with. You can watch registers   ≤€
€≤    , flags and memory while your program executes.                       ≤€
€≤    Arithmetic & Logical Unit (ALU) shows the internal work of the        ≤€
€≤    central processor unit (CPU).                                         ≤€
€≤    Emulator runs programs on a Virtual PC, this completely blocks your   ≤€
€≤    program from accessing real hardware, such as hard-drives and         ≤€
€≤    memory, since your assembly code runs on a virtual machine, this      ≤€
€≤    makes debugging much easier.                                          ≤€
€≤    8086 machine code is fully compatible with all next generations of    ≤€
€≤    Intel's micro-processors, including Pentium II and Pentium 4,         ≤€
€≤    Pentium 5 will support 8086 as well. This makes 8086 code very        ≤€
€≤    portable, since it runs both on ancient and on the modern computer    ≤€
€≤    systems. Another advantage of 8086 instruction set is that it is      ≤€
€≤    much smaller, and thus easier to learn.                               ≤€
