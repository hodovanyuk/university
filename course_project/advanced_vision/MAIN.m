% compute the background image

% multiple condensation states
% states <- {moving , not moving}
% probability of moving and not moving

% generate Nhyp new hypothesis from current state

generate predictions 
step to next image
update hypothesis weight
loop generate

why should i even make hypothesis if any way i will search object on image?
